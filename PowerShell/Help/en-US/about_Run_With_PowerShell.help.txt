Short description

Explains how to use the RUN WITH POWERSHELL feature to run a script from a
file system drive.


Long description

Beginning in Windows PowerShell 3.0, you can use the RUN WITH POWERSHELL
feature to run scripts from File Explorer. The RUN WITH POWERSHELL feature
is designed to run scripts that don't have required parameters and don't
return output to the command prompt.

When you use the RUN WITH POWERSHELL feature, the Windows PowerShell
console window appears only briefly, if at all. You can't interact with it.

To use the RUN WITH POWERSHELL feature:

In File Explorer (or Windows Explorer), right-click the script filename and
then select RUN WITH POWERSHELL.

The RUN WITH POWERSHELL feature starts a Windows PowerShell session that
has an execution policy of Bypass, runs the script, and closes the session.

It runs a command that has the following format:

    PowerShell.exe -File <FileName> -ExecutionPolicy Bypass

RUN WITH POWERSHELL sets the Bypass execution policy only for the session
(the current instance of the PowerShell process) in which the script runs.
This feature doesn't change the execution policy for the computer or the
user.

The RUN WITH POWERSHELL feature is affected only by the AllSigned execution
policy. If the AllSigned execution policy is effective for the computer or
the user, RUN WITH POWERSHELL runs only signed scripts. RUN WITH POWERSHELL
is not affected by any other execution policy. For more information, see
about_Execution_Policies.

  [!NOTE] RUN WITH POWERSHELL feature might prompt you to confirm the
  execution policy change.
